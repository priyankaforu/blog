<h1 style="text-align: center">The Evens Of Being Unlike</h1><br>
The world encourages, only if you fit in the junk around you. Looking weird, a bit different gonna throw you out of that junk. Someone who isn't aware of this crippled society can't decide to stand on which side. Wellll this is a tough situation though! Ahm, the weakest chooses the path of being controlled instead controlling the weaker. If you ask a scholar what to choose between "being dumb" or "following the dumb". He would say doing either would make you the dumbest. Then lorddd!!, what to choose ...<br></br>

Follow what you like, face the hatred, stand on one side, choose left or right. Gray can help you look like a normal but never gonna make you great. Outstanding results is not for any ordinary man, coming home at 6:00pm , chilling on a recliner, and ending the day by playing with kids. Whichever domain you are working in , whatever topic that interests you be like a brucelee in Martial arts, Jackson in dance, Nietzsche in Poetry, Telsa in innovation, Einstein in science.<br></br>

If you can't be abnormal, explain me what you played after your death!
